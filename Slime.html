									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Slime 15.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 15<br></b></b>I've been killing slimes for 300 years, and my family has finally decided on my birthday! We didn’t have a date until now (mainly because I forgot it…), but my daughters are going to celebrate it with me this year, and I'm really, really excited! Later, I meet the goddess of fate (I can't be surprised anymore!), I help out a phantom thief (and my family grows), and I visit a strange land where there are no slimes! I'll share another short story from a drama CD at the end, so don't miss it! <br><br><a href="https://yenpress.com/titles/9781975361938-i-ve-been-killing-slimes-for-300-years-and-maxed-out-my-level-vol-15"><b>Buy (Official Site)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Slime 16.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 16<br></b></b>I've been killing slimes for 300 years, and now my family is trying for comedy gold?! I was just engaging in some light banter about being reincarnated when my daughter recognized my talent (?) for snappy comebacks and asked me to write a script… Meanwhile, our new family member, the mimic, warms up to Halkara (they go on a walk together) and I try my hand at the gods' newest video game (or should I say newest world?). And finally, Laika's back at it in The Red-Dragon Academy for Girls!<br><br><a href="https://yenpress.com/titles/9781975388737-i-ve-been-killing-slimes-for-300-years-and-maxed-out-my-level-vol-16"><b>Buy (Official Site)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
