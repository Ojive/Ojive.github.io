							<p>I'm not allowed to talk about some projects, be it because they're unannounced, under NDA, or suffering from some other set of unique circumstances, and this is one of them! I've listed it here because sometimes projects stay secret for a very, very long time, and when I was first putting my portfolio together it looked empty without the undisclosables included. Hopefully I'll get to tell you what this is sometime in the near future!</p>
