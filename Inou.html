							<h1>When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace</h1>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 1.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Company: J-Novel Club<br>Status: 10/13 volumes translated<br><br></b>Andou Jurai is a second-year highschooler with the mind of an eighth-grade edgelord. His self-indulgent fantasies and over the top antics make him a constant pain in the neck for his friends in the literary club...until, that is, they all suddenly awaken to spectacular supernatural powers! Their godlike abilities include stopping time, manipulating the elements, creating matter from nothing, subverting the very laws of reality, and...producing black fire that doesn’t burn. (Some superpowers are more godlike than others.) Andou's read enough comics to know what comes next: it’s only a matter of time before they'll be dragged into life-or-death battles with the fate of the world itself at stake! The world, however, disagrees. There are no villains, no battles, no earth-shattering disasters—nothing whatsoever. Half a year later, the literary club finds themselves confronting a new question: what do you do with supernatural powers when your day to day life is as commonplace as ever?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace">Official Site</a></p>
